    <p>┈➤First stop:Pompeii, Campania</p>
    <p>
      When you visit this ancient Roman city, you’ll be struck by the tragic
      plaster casts that show Pompeii’s citizens in their final moments of life,
      but also by how life-like the spectacular city is: wander its ancient
      streets and imagine Romans buying bread or heading to the bar, as you
      would in any modern Italian city. It’s as memorable and striking as the
      Colosseum in Rome.
